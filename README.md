A simple program which brings rich presence to your profile.

## How to setup
1. Download the repo and enter it in your terminal program. Then type 'npm install'. This will install the things needed for this to work.
2. Change the config.json file, the instructions are in the file.
3. Thats it! Run the program with 'node main.js'
We recommend using a program like pm2 to keep the program alive.

### Planned features
I am planning on making a UI in which lets you customize what you can already (text etc) and lets you select a logo
to display in the text box. For example an internet icon, gaming icon, music icon etc.
